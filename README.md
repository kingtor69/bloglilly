# BlogLilly?

which I called BlogLilly as a typo and decided to keep it

### how it works:
 - **SQLAlchemy will be looking for a database called /bloglilly/**
 - there is no log-in or authentication, so anyone can post on behalf of anyone else, edit all users, delete users, add users, etc.
 - aside from that, I think it's fairly self-explanatory

### future development ideas:
 - add the ability to add new tags when writing or editing a post
 - display the latest post from all users on the /users page
 - flesh out the nav-bar a bit more to add links for tag management, creating a new post or user
